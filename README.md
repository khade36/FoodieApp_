# FoodieApp_

As a Full Stack Developer, I was tasked with creating an innovative e-Foodie App platform that offers a user-friendly experience and robust backend functionality. The project involved using Spring Boot and Java for the backend, with MongoDB and MySQL databases to store and manage data. On the frontend, I utilized HTML, CSS, Material UI, Bootstrap, and Angular 13 to create an attractive and responsive user interface.
