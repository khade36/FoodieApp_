# FoodieApp_

As a Full Stack Developer, I was tasked with creating an innovative e-Foodie App platform that offers a user-friendly experience and robust backend functionality. The project involved using Spring Boot and Java for the backend, with MongoDB and MySQL databases to store and manage data. On the front end, I utilized HTML, CSS, Material UI, and Angular 13 to create an attractive and responsive user interface.
